Steps to run program:
- Download zip file and extract folder
- Open folder in command prompt
- Type: python main.py

####For Students:
#### The program will ask you if you want to see today's assignments:
When you select:
-yes
  * Assignments due "today" will be displayed. If there are no assignments -1 will be returned
  * You will be prompted if you want to push to Microsoft Teams:
    - If yes:
    * You will paste in your webhook in there and press enter

####For TAs and Professors:
#### Do you have one webhook you would like to use always?

If you want to use the same webhook everytime in case you would like to push open the main.py file and inside begin_collection() paste in your webhook inside quotes and save. Now everytime you select to push to microsoft teams it will use that webhook.



#### Feel free to play around with the code and change it!
